A facebook chat application for Windows desktop environment using Smack API

Install instructions:

This is an eclipse project. Just import into Eclipse.

Libraries used:
smack-core-4.0.0.jar
smack-debug-4.0.0.jar
smack-extensions-4.0.0.jar
smack-tcp-4.0.0.jar

These can be found here: http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/

commons-collections-3.2.1.jar

This can be found here: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/download_collections.cgi

NOTE: 
1)The commons collections jar is not the current version. Take care while downloading.
2)The commons collections jar is used for authentication. However, the authentication will soon be changed to the facebook SASL standard.
So this is temporary.

The project, in its current form, DOES NOT work.
